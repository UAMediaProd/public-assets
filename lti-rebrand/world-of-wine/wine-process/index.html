                    White wine grapes are harvested at cool ambient temperatures
                    when the sugar, acid and flavour levels are determined to be
                    suitable for the wine style being produced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harvested grapes are transported to the winery for
                    processing.

                    Grapes can be chilled upon arrival at the winery, especially
                    in warmer regions with Mediterranean climates. Grapes are
                    destemmed and crushed to produce the must (juice and grape
                    solids) prior to pressing. With whole bunch pressing this
                    step is not required.

                    The must is pressed to obtain the juice for fermentation.
                    This produces free run juice (no pressure is applied) and
                    pressings, which are usually fermented separately but can be
                    blended back in some proportion later in the process.

                    Adjustments of tartaric acid or sugar concentration can be
                    performed at this stage, depending on local regulations, and
                    sulfur dioxide may be added prior to pressing.

                    After pressing, white juice is typically cold-settled and
                    decanted to another vessel to provide clarification of the
                    juice prior to inoculation with yeast. The juice is
                    inoculated with the selected yeast (many available) that is
                    usually pre-cultured by the winery or added as active dry
                    yeast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fermentation occurs in stainless steel tanks, or oak barrels
                    in some instances, depending on the style the winemaker aims
                    to produce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yeast nutrients may be added if the grapes are deficient,
                    and a steady fermentation rate is preferred; this can be
                    maintained by manipulating the temperature of the ferment if
                    necessary (around or below 20 °C).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aeration during the first few days of fermentation can
                    ensure a healthy yeast population (efficient conversion of
                    sugar and non-stressed yeast).

                    Once a ferment has reached the desired residual sugar (&lt;
                    2 gm/L for a dry wine), the wine is cooled and allowed to
                    settle, then racked off gross lees under an atmosphere of
                    inert gas to prevent oxygen from spoiling the wine.

                <p>
                    The wine may be matured in oak barrels or undergo lees
                    ageing for several months, with some form of occasional
                    agitation of the lees; this can be used to enhance the

                    Malolactic fermentation (MLF) can also occur, to deacidify

                    Harvest timing depends on the wine style being produced and
                    the flavour intensity of the grapes; riper grapes produce
                    red wines with fuller body, more flavour and colour, and
                    higher alcohol.

                    Harvested grapes are transported to the winery for

                    The next part of the process largely relates to extracting

                    Some juice may be run off prior to inoculation to increase
                    the ratio of skins to juice in the remaining must.
                    Pre-fermentative cold-soaking or must heating can be used to
                    facilitate extraction of phenolic compounds, and
                    anthocyanins in particular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the days after fermentation begins, the skins rise to the
                    top of the fermenter and form a thick “cap”. The
                    conventional practices aimed at extracting the phenolics and
                    other matter from the cap can involve periodic operations
                    such as pushing down the floating skins, pumping the
                    fermenting juice over the cap, or decanting and returning
                    the fermenting juice over the cap. Heading-down boards can
                    be used instead to keep the cap submerged under the surface
                    of the fermenting juice, or specifically designed
                    fermentation vessels can be employed.

                    The choice of yeast strain is another factor that affects

                    Red wines undergo an important part of the ageing process in
                    tanks or oak barrels after fermentation. This maturation
                    allows the wine to stabilise and clarify, imparts beneficial
                    oak components when barrels are used, and leads to reactions
                    which impact wine colour and mouthfeel; that is, reactions
                    which occur to make the colour long-lived and the mouthfeel
                    less harsh.

                    Additions of sulfur dioxide and tartaric acid can occur at
                    this time, along with fining to moderate the phenolic
                    profile, mostly related to astringency; there is also
                    periodic decanting of the wine from any sediment, then
                    returning it to the vessel.

                    Wine is then decanted from the settled solids and further
                    clarified if necessary (e.g. by centrifugation) and
                    inoculated for malolactic fermentation (MLF) to deacidify
                    and improve sensory characters. MLF can also occur
                    spontaneously and concurrently with alcoholic fermentation.

                    After a period of maturation in tank or barrel, the wine is
                    decanted and blended to produce the final wine, further
                    stabilised if necessary, clarified, analysed and adjusted,
                    and carefully stored in readiness for bottling.

                    Bottling may be done in house or through a contractor, and
                    any equipment that will make contact with the wine is
                    sanitised prior to use.

                    Wine is often filtered through a membrane filter for
                    bottling under sterile conditions to remove microorganisms.
                    Winemakers may decide to bottle with minimal or no
                    filtration, to avoid stripping of components (primarily
                    colour-related).

                    Additional changes can occur over an extended period of time
                    which improve wine after it is bottled. There is further
                    moderation of sensory characters and development of
                    complexity.
