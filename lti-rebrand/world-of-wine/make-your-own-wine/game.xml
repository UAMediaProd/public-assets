elegant palate structure, and is dry with a pleasant finish."  />
<result medal="Bronze" text="Congratulations! You have made a Bronze Medal winning wine It exhibits a stony, lime and citrus-scented
nose, with fresh, medium-bodied flavours and a clean, tangy finish."  />

<result medal="Competent" text="Medium red, tinged with brown. Both the bouquet and the palate show rather astringent green leaf and
earth aromas and flavours. Not bad, not great."  />
<result medal="Average" text="Quite ordinary. Will go perfectly with any food that will mask its taste. Good Barbeque Red."  />
<result medal="Poison" text="Fantastically bad. Warrants a public health warning. Resembles some by-product of the petro-chemical
process. Seek professional help, or read the hints, before making more wine."  />

<wine wine="chardonnay">
<result medal="Gold" text="Congratulations! You have made a Gold Medal winning wine. This is a medium, yellow-green Chardonnay with a
complex toasty bouquet showing both barrel ferment and malo-lactic ferment influences. On the palate this has figgy,
buttery and oatmeal flavours and is mouth filling."  />
<result medal="Silver" text="Congratulations! You have made a Silver Medal winning wine. It is medium yellow-green in colour with ripe
melon and white peach fruit evident on the bouquet. The palate is pleasant and round with a creamy texture and taste." />
<result medal="Bronze" text="Congratulations! You have won a Bronze Medal for your wine. Pale green-yellow in colour with a fragrant melon and white peach bouquet plus a hint of spicy French oak. The palate is clean, fresh and melony."  />
<result medal="Competent" text="A plain bouquet with some minty aromas leads on to a palate on which melon flavours show through. The
oak is a touch pedestrian."  />
<result medal="Average" text="A very ordinary Chardonnay. May be redeemed by its price."  />
<result medal="Poison" text="Perfect example of the new trend in grape-based disinfectants. Staggeringly awful. Please seek professional
help, or read the hints, before making more wine."  />

<wine wine="shiraz">
<result medal="Gold" text="Congratulations! You have made a Gold Medal winning wine. This deep red-purple Shiraz has a voluminous
bouquet with solid spicy, plum Shiraz aromas backed by well-balanced coconut oak. This is a rich and generous wine on
the palate with a youthful red berry fruit and a soft finish."  />
<result medal="Silver" text="Congratulations! You have made a Silver Medal winning wine. Medium to full purple red in colour, there is a
smooth cherry fruit on the bouquet with hints of vanilla oak. The palate is long, with generous berry flavours, finishing
with fine tannins."  />
<result medal="Bronze" text="Congratulations! You have won a Bronze Medal for your wine. The wine is medium purple-red, with a
chocolate bouquet with liquorice overtones and the palate is dense, heavy and chewy."  />
<result medal="Competent" text="Medium-red to purple in colour. The wine has earthy and leathery aromas with considerable astringency
on the palate."  />
<result medal="Average" text="Surprisingly light colour. A very disappointing bouquet with distinct medicinal aroma. The palate is marginally
better, but this a very ordinary wine."  />
<result medal="Poison" text="Appalling. More likely to be sold at garden centres than in wine shops. You have single handedly destroyed the
reputation of your company. Please seek professional help, or read the hints, before making more wine."  />
